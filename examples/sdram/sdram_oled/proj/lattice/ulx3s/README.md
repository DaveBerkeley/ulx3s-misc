    X/Y movement works.
    Left, Right button clicks and Wheel press (aka middle button) work.

Wheel rotation is not supported yet.

The initialization procedure is not very plug-n-play.
Here's a manual procedure that gets it working:

    0. plug mouse out
    1. upload this bitstream
    2. click btn0 to reset
    3. plug mouse in
    4. click btn0 to reset
    5. click mouse left/right buttons and move mouse, LEDs will show it
